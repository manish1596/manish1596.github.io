Hi! I am Manish, currently working as a Research Engineer in the Perception Team at [Qualcomm AI Research](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/artificial-intelligence/ai-research). Prior to this, I graduated with a [MS in CSE](https://cse.ucsd.edu/graduate/degree-programs/ms-program) at UC San Diego. At UCSD, I worked with [Prof. Kamalika Chaudhuri](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~kamalika/) on online learning and with [Prof. Rose Yu](http://roseyu.com/) on a project aimed at unsupervised relational inference in dynamically changing systems. I am interested in both the theoretical and applied aspects of machine learning. I am particularly excited about the applications of machine learning in dynamically evolving systems. In the past, I was a [Research Fellow at Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/research-fellows-program-at-microsoft-research-india/) working on graph representation learning in the Applied Machine Learning group.<br/><br/>
At UCSD, my coursework involved working on applications of Machine Learning in areas like Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. I have also taken many theoretical courses in machine learning in order to understand the theoretical aspects of the area. Throughout my Machine Learning projects, I have extensively used PyTorch and TensorFlow. I am also well versed with C/C++ and Golang.<br/><br/>
I earned my Bachelors degree in [Computer Science from IIT Varanasi](https://iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse) where I worked on image captioning models for limited paired image-caption data for my bachelors thesis. I was ranked 3rd in the graduating batch of CSE department during my undergrad.
